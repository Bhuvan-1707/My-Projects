 ## MFC_Convolution
 
 A small Flask web application that performs **linear** and **circular convolution** on two integer vectors, displays the results, and lets the user download the results (and optionally plots) from the browser.
 
 ---
 
 ## ✨ Features
 
 - Enter two integer vectors component‑wise using small input boxes on the home page.  
 - Compute either **Linear Convolution** or **Circular Convolution** of the two vectors.  
 - Display the input vectors and the resulting convolution vector on a results page.  
 - Optionally generate and display a **Matplotlib** plot of the input vectors and the convolution result.  
 - Download:
   - The results section as a **JPEG** using a client‑side HTML‑to‑image capture.  
   - The saved plot image generated by the server, if available.

 ## 🚀 Getting Started
 
 ### Prerequisites
 
 - Python >= 3.10
 - `pip`
 
 ### Installation
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/Bhuvan-1707/My-Projects
 cd MFC_Convolution
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
 ### Run the app
 
 **Development (Flask built‑in server):**
 
 ```
 python app.py
 ```
 
 **Production (Gunicorn):**
 
 ```
 gunicorn app:app
 ```
 
 Then open a browser and go to:
 
 - http://127.0.0.1:5000/

 ## 👨‍💻 Usage
 
 1. On the **home** page, enter integer components for **Vector 1** and **Vector 2** using the input boxes (use the “Add” button to append more components).\
 Note: The Random is applied to output random integer vectors as the same size of number of input vectors in the respective vector.
 2. Choose the operation:
    - Click **LConv** to compute linear convolution.  
    - Click **CConv** to compute circular convolution.  
 3. The **results** page will display:
    - The two input vectors.  
    - The resulting convolution vector.  
 4. (Optional) Click **Plot** to generate a Matplotlib figure of:
    - Vector 1  
    - Vector 2  
    - Convolution result  
    The plot is saved to `static/images/plot.png` and displayed on the page.  
 5. To download:
    - Use the **Download** button to capture the results as a **JPEG** image client‑side (via an HTML‑to‑image library `html2canvas`).  
    - If a plot was generated, the saved plot image will also be visible and can be downloaded/viewed from the browser.

 ## 📦 Dependencies
 
 Main dependencies:
 
 - **Flask** – web framework.  
 - **Matplotlib** – plotting of input vectors and results.  
 - **Gunicorn** – WSGI HTTP server for production deployments.

 ## 🌐 Deployment
 
 This app targets platforms that allow server‑side file writing, since plots are written to `static/images/plot.png`.  
 
 Typical steps:
 
 1. Ensure the following files and folders are present on the server:
    - `app.py`  
    - `requirements.txt`  
    - `Procfile`  
    - `templates/`  
    - `static/` (including `static/images/`)  
 2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
 3. Use the `Procfile` entry:
    ```
    web: gunicorn app:app
    ```
 4. Ensure the platform provides:
    - A writable filesystem (for `static/images/plot.png`).  
    - Any required environment variables (e.g. Flask secret key).

 This app is deployed and can be used globally using the url https://convolution-app.onrender.com/
